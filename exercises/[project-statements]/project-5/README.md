# Concept
Conference Website

The objective of this coding challenge is to craft a website that presents a conference using HTML and CSS. Your task is to design and implement a visually captivating and user-friendly online platform that provides an interesting overview for prospective attendees.

## Goals
1. Set up a blank HTML file with links to your CSS file/s.

2. Choose a conference topic (this will probably be a bit of a fantasy topic for most of us, but can actually be used as a template if you happen to organize something similar in the future)

3. Plan the content you intend to feature on the conference website. Consider organizing information into sections such as "Speakers," "Agenda," "Prizes," and any other pertinent details that you feel people should know. 

4. Develop the structure of your HTML page.

5. Start designing each section of your page. Here are some guidelines that you can follow if you simply want to develop your CSS skills and not worry about structure:
    * Header section
        * Include a conference "logo" and a catchy phrase that could summarize the aim of your conference;
        * Take extra caution at designing the typography of the event name, as it has a great impact on whoever accesses a website. Use a prominent, legible font;
        * Add a navigation menu with links to the different sections of the webpage;
    * Speakers section
        * Create individual panels for each speaker with their name, photo, and what concept they'll be covering.
        * Use a consistent layout for speaker panels to maintain visual harmony;
        * You should use flex or grid to place more speakers on the same line;
        * You may even add an effect on hover, to highlight whom the cursor is on at a specific point. (! Something even more interesting would be if when a user hovered over a speaker, the speakers' card would turn around by 180deg and showcase a description of the specific speaker, just like a card);
    * Agenda section
        *  Organize the agenda in a clear and easy-to-read format, possibly in a timetable or schedule style by using a grid / flex layout;
        * Use contrasting colors to distinguish between different sessions or tracks;
    * Prizes section
        * Showcase the prizes with interesting and attractive visuals, such as images;
        * Provide details about each prize;
        * Consider using a grid layout for an organized section.
    * Registration section;
        * Design a form for attendees to register for the event.
        * Use an aesthetically pleasing palette;
        * Check whether specific asks have been met (such as a field being required), and color them accordingly based on status (e.g red for invalid; green for valid) using pseudo-classes;
    * Footer section
        * Provide contact information, any links that you find relevant (such as social media), and copyright notice;
        * You may add a back-to-top button (you don't need Javascript to achieve this functionality, you can simply make the button an anchor with the href set to the id of the header element, for instance, #header).
