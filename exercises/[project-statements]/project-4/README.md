# Concept
Sign Up Form


We will be building a sign-up form, which is, essentially, a concise overview of the user registration form on a website or application. It provides users with essential information about the purpose of the form and encourages them to create an account.

## Goals
1. Set up a blank HTML file with links to your CSS file/s.

2. Choose a mock product that you want users to sign up for (don't waste too much time on this :))

3. Develop a HTML structure for your project. You can include:
    * a photo which may fill up a good chunk of your screen for design;
    * the actual form, in which you can devise some fields such as name, email, phone number, password etc;
    * a 'create account' button.
(take a look at the 4.PNG image to see a suggested design)

4. Make the design fit in with the picture you choose. Make sure the picture you chose fits in perfectly in the space, otherwise look into the background property (perhaps background-repeat). Add visual confirmation / infirmation cues, such as making a field red if it is required. (tip: you can achieve this using a pseudo-class)
