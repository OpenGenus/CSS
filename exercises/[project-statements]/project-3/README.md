# Concept
Product listing page

We will be building a product listing which is, essentially, a concise and compelling overview of a specific product presented briefly. It provides essential information to potential customers, encouraging them to learn more or make a purchase.

## Goals
1. Set up a blank HTML file with links to your CSS file/s.

2. Choose a mock product you want to present (e.g sunglasses)

3. Develop a HTML structure for your product. Include:
    * a back button;
    * a picture of your product;
    * title;
    * some categories to which it might pertain;
    * rating;
    * price;
    * 'Add to cart' button;
    * description.

4. Style your product listing. (Check out the 3-desktop.PNG and 3-mobile.PNG files for a suggestion of how you might style your project)
