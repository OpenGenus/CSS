# Concept
Blog preview card

We will be building a blog preview card, which is, essentially, a concise overview of a blog post presented in the form of a card. It typically includes essential information that gives readers a quick insight into the content of the blog post. 

## Goals
1. Set up a blank HTML file with links to your CSS file/s.

2. Choose a mock topic for your article (e.g CSS foundations). You may use filler text for its description (here you go: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.)

3. Start developing the HTML structure for your blog card. It should contain:
    * a representative picture of the article;
    * various 'tags' that represent categories it could be found in (such as 'Coding', 'Learning' etc.);
    * publish date;
    * title;
    * description;
    * author.

4. Design the card. Here are some tips:
    * center it on the page (try it both using flex and using the transform property);
    * you can use border-radius to give it a bit of an edge. Consider applying it both to the container and the image, if you like;    * make each tag that you place in a container of a specific color (e.g Coding can be red, Learning can be yellow etc.)
    * apply a different font to the title and make it bold;
    * consider applying a small amount of box-shadow to the card container.
