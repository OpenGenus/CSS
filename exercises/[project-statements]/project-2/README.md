# Concept
Testimonials

We'll be building a testimonials section, which is, essentially, a concise presentation of positive statements or feedback provided by individuals or clients who have experienced a product, service, or an overall interaction with a business.

## Goals
1. Set up a blank HTML file with links to your CSS file/s.

2. Develop the HTML structure of 5 testimonials, each containing:
    * an author section, with a profile picture and said author's name;
    * title;
    * description.

3. Using grid, the 6 testimonials shall be placed 3 on each line, as such:
    * the first shall only occupy the first line, but be double in width;
    * the second shall only occupy 1x in width and 1x in height;
    * the third shall be 1x in width, but occupy both lines;
    * the fourth shall be 1x in width and 1x in height, placed on the second line;
    * the fifth shall be 2x in width and normal in height, placed on the second line.

4. Design each testimonial differently, as you see fit. Here is a suggested color palette, make the background of each testimonial different (remember to change the color of the text also, in order to make it clearly visible):
    * \#d90429
    * \#ef233c
    * \#edf2f4
    * \#8d99ae
    * \#2b2d42
