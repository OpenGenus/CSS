# Layout - exercise 1

This is meant to be solved after reading through the **Layout** chapter of the book.

## Goal/s
1. Your goal here is to make the span element ( box ) stop overlapping with the writing. 

## Starting indications 
All properties needed to solve this exercise can be found within the **Layout** chapter of the book. 

Let's explain the existing CSS code:

First of all, you can see the universal selector structure we explained in the previous exercise.

We are also making the paragraph 50% of the page, so that we can visualize it a bit better.

Then, we are taking the span element inside of the paragraph and setting its background, a border, and some padding.

If you now open the page, however, you can see that the span box overlaps with the other text or/and even gets cut off if it's at the end of the line. Think about how you could fix that.

## Solution
If, at any point during this exercise, you get stuck and want to see the correct solution, you can access the 'solution' folder, where you will notice:
1. The same files, only modified to reveal the correct solution.
2. Pictures of how the final solution should look like implemented on screen.
