# Layout - exercise 3

This is meant to be solved after reading through the **Layout** chapter of the book.

## Goal/s
1. Your goal here is to try to immitate the dashboard provided in the preview.PNG file.

## Starting indications 
This is an exercise that puts into practice everything that we've learned so far.

First of all, an important skill that you should attempt to learn is breaking the project down into smaller steps. What you see now in the preview.PNG may seem a bit overwhelming, but, for starters, we could start by dividing it this way:
* Header
* Main Section
* Sidebar

We can take each of those and style them appropriately. 

Tip: Use grid in order to align the header, main and sidebar on the page, and use flex / grid ( whatever you're most comfortable with ) for aligning elements within the aforementioned. 

You can use any color palette you wish, and it doesn't have to exactly match the picture provided ( approximated values may vary ).

Lastly, take your time and have fun!
