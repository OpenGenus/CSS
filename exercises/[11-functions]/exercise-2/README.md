# Functions - exercise 1

This is meant to be solved after reading through the **Functions** chapter of the book.

## Goal/s
1. Aim to realize, using the aid of the styling already provided in the styles.css file, a design alike to the one in the preview.PNG file.

## Starting indications 
First of all, let's take the time to analyze the code written in the provided styles.css file.

We can notice a :root element, which is quite literally the 'root' of our stylesheet, where we can store our **variables**. You can notice that the syntax to define a variable is by adding 2 hyphens (--) and the variable name, followed by a colon and the value of the variable, the latter part being much similar to normal property-value definitions in CSS.

There are 2 variables provided for you, although you can mix and match with whatever color palette you prefer. 

Then, the body and container are styled similar to what you've encountered before. The body is set to take up the entire viewport, while the .container is a box in the aforementioned's midst. The .container element is where we'll be placing our 'picture'. 

In order to assign variables, you should treat them as normal values, only adding the keyword var before them, much like this:
* background-color: var(--leaf);

Keep in mind that this is a very artistic project, and you might not get the exact values right to make it look precisely like the one provided in the preview.PNG file. 

Just look forward to your aim: to learn CSS functions. Don't worry if the end result is not identical to the one in the preview.PNG file.

Good luck!
