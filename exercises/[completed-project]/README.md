# Completed Project

This project is meant to be perused after reading the book, so as to cement all of the concepts learned within it.

This is the only project that has a proposed solution, while the others will be completely up to you!

## Concept
Interactive Resume
The goal of this coding challenge is to create an interactive resume using HTML and CSS. You are expected to design and implement a visually appealing and user-friendly online resume that provides an engaging user experience. 


## Goals
1. Set up a blank HTML file with links to your CSS file/s.
2. Think about the information you are going to write in your resume. You can start structuring your content into sections, such as "Personal", "Work experience", "Education", "Certifications" etc. Here, you can provide real information if you wish to use it as your resume further on.
3. After having decided on the structure of your resume, you can start thinking about design and interactivity.
    * **Design** is up to you. You can think about making each section a different color, or, perhaps, animating each of them in a different style. 
    * **Interactivity** shall be achieved without using Javascript. This is going to be rather rough, but it will be great at helping you apply what we've been preaching in this book all along. In order to achieve interactivity without using Javascript, we can use checkboxes. We will make each heading into a checkbox, and will use the :checked pseudo-class we learned about to make them visible.
4. Now, all that's left to do is to think whether your design is responsive, that is, can be viewed on all devices without any distortions.

## Additional notes
Keep in mind that this is a completed project, therefore, while solving it completely on your own is encouraged, you may always take a peek at the proposed solution to give you a boost forward.

Even if you do solve it yourself, it is highly encouraged that you still take a look at the proposed solution, as it may have been solved in a way you did not consider and can still learn something from it. 

Finally, we hope that you have fun and that this is a project that you can learn as much as possible from! Happy coding!
