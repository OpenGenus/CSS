# Linking CSS - exercise 1

Welcome to the first exercise! This is meant to be solved after reading through the **Linking CSS** chapter of the book.

## Goal
Your only goal here is to link the 'styles.css' file to the 'index.html' one.

## Starting indications 
The only file you need to modify is the index.html one. You have a short list of styles in the styles.css file that you need to apply to the HTML, using any of the linking CSS modes you've just learned. 
Keep in mind, that, since we have two files, this is **external linking**!
Don't worry about the CSS for now, just know that your webpage should turn red when you have successfully linked the HTML and CSS.

**Recommendation**
Try to link the CSS in all ways possible, so that you can have multiple ways to go next time you need to do this ( and I assure you, that's gonna be a lot of next times ). Especially focus on the external CSS linking method, since that is the one you're likely to use most, but if you want to do something a bit extra, you can try copying the style from the CSS file, and linking it both internally and inline. 

## Solution
If, at any point during this exercise, you get stuck and want to see the correct solution, you can access the 'solution' folder, where you will notice:
1. The same files, only modified to reveal the correct solution;
2. Pictures of how the final solution should look like implemented on screen.  

Note: While you'll see all linking modes implemented in the solution, you only have to choose **one**.
