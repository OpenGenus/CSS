# Values and properties - exercise 1

This is meant to be solved after reading through the **Values and Properties** chapter of the book.

This will be the first project you create by yourself entirely! Don't worry, though, you will be guided all throughout it! 

## Goal/s
1. Create a div with a width of 150px and a height of 200px. Set its background color to #FF6663.
2. Create a paragraph inside of it, with the color #E0FF4F. Set its text size to 20px.
3. Position the paragraph to the right of the div, and make the text be crossed out with a line. 

## Starting indications 
First of all, you have to create the HTML and CSS files. Don't forget to link them together! 

You will find all of the required properties and their values in the **Values and Properties** chapter of this book.
